Mean Stack Relational
=====================

MEAN (**MySQL, Express, Angular, Node) - A Simple, Scalable and Easy starting point for javascript web development - utilizing many of the best practices we've found on the way.

The main idea for this repository is shamelessly stolen from [http://mean.io](http://mean.io). 

The main objective is to switch out [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) for [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/) so that this library can be used with any relational database.
